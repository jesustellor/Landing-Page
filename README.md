# Landing Page Project

This project was assigned to me by Udacity as part of the Front End Developer Nanodegree.

The project requirements were to:

1. Build a multi-section landing page.
2. The navbar should have links to each section of the page.
3. When a link in the navbar is clicked, the page should scroll to the corresponding section rather than snap to it.
4. The section that is currently being viewed should have its corresponding link in the navbar highlighted.

I was given a basic HTML structure and a CSS file with some basic styles to get started. I wrote the necessary JavaScript code to fulfill the requirements.

*****NOTE:*** you can run the project by running the index.html file in the browser.
